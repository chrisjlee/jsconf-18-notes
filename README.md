## Track A: Billy Roh

Take inspiration from art specifically the [obliteration room](https://play.qagoma.qld.gov.au/looknowseeforever/works/obliteration_room/)

Poly [poly.google.com](poly.google.com)

a-frame has a asset management system
create id for each item

## A-Frame
- Mozilla framework
- uses semantic syntax
- <a-entity> is a generic container
- can create games

## Lighting

- Spotlight
- Directional (like the sun)
- Hemisphere (ambient)

Can set decay from sorce, distance, etc

Using a single light will turn off other lights
- Be intentional
- each light incurs performance cost
- 12 light sources -> 20 fps
- 3 light sources -> 30fps

Create stickers to add to scene

## Physics engine
A frame provides engine to 
- Bodies
  - Dynamic body can move
  - static body will be stick

## collision event listeners
- can turn them into a static body after it is collide with object

Each of the stickers land ackwardly because the physics engine assumes its a box
- for optimization it's a box

## moving forward
- can create paintings
- can download and remix too
- with vr can be meaingful interactive
